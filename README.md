# Hackernews Clone Built with React, Graphql, Prisma and Apollo.

## Demo

Deployed [here](http://hn-clone-seven.vercel.app/).

## Deployment

To deploy this project locally first Navigate into the server directory and run the following commands to start the server:

```bash
cd react-apollo/server

#npm
  npm install
  npm start
#yarn
  yarn install
  yarn dev
```

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well, but you need to be in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory react-apollo (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

You can now open your browser and use the app on http://localhost:3000.
